          <p>Thank you for everything though saige. You were awesome, beautiful, funny, silly, competent, smart, genuine, caring, thoughtful, and athletic. You were yourself and I loved it. You’re on my mind all the time I am doing a lot of stuff now because ik you would be proud or its stuff you and I would do. I go out and sit at the bridge a lot like we did that one day because I miss you and I miss the things we would do. I still care about you a lot and I dont want you stressing. I hope you find a job you love and eat healthy every day remember 3 meals a day ideally.  I need my best friend back i cant let you go you are the most amazing person i met i admire you so much and i want you in my life if you let me. i want to show you i am a different person for the better but still the same goofy ahh wearing shorts guy you liked. call me or smth or lmk if i can see you the day u come </p>
